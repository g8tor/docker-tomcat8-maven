# About this Repo

This repo is my attempt to contribute to the [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org) community as well as an
attempt to make my life easier when trying to deploy a VIVO instance at work.

# Points of Interest
This resulting docker image is based on the [official Tomcat 8](https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat/)
[Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) based image. Please note, the alpine based image was selected in an effort to keep the image as small as possible.

# What's in it for me?
OOTB users of this image will have openjdk8, Tomcat 8 and [apache-maven-3.3.9](https://maven.apache.org/) deployment environment.

# Finally

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND YOUR USE OF THIS IMAGE IS @ YOUR OWN RISK
